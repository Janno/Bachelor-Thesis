Regular languages are well studied and research on this topic spans over half a century. Apart from the well-known application in parsing, regular expressions and the underlying Kleene algebras have been used in program verification, finding the shortest path in directed weighted graphs, and many other areas of computer science. Recent publications in this area have dealt with the formalization of regular derivatives, equivalence testing on regular expressions, and the Myhill-Nerode theorem. The frameworks used include Coq and Isabelle. Following this recent interest in formalizing regular languages, we aim to provide an extensive yet elegant formalization in Coq (Ssreflect) based on finite automata. We will show equivalence of three characterizations of regular languages: finite automata, regular expressions and the Myhill-Nerode theorem.
