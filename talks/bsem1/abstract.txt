Regular languages are well studied and research on this topic spans over half a century. Recent publications presented formalizations of equivalence testing on regular expressions (2011, Coquand et al. in Coq; 2011 Krauss et al. in Isabelle, 2011 Moreira in Coq), and the Myhill-Nerode theorem (2011, Xu et al. in Isabelle; 1997, Constable in Nuprl). Following this recent interest in formalizing regular languages, we aim to provide an elegant formalization in Coq (Ssreflect) based on finite automata. We want to show equivalence of three characterizations of regular languages: finite automata, regular expressions and the Myhill-Nerode theorem. While current work in this field mostly focuses on regular derivatives (Coquand, Xu, Krauss, Moreira), we want to employ finite automata for both equivalence testing and the Myhill-Nerode theorem.
