\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
We have shown that all characterizations presented in this thesis
are equally expressive.

Theorem \ref{dfa_to_nfa} and Theorem \ref{nfa_to_dfa} 
show the equivalence of deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata.

We have shown that there is an equivalent DFA for every extended regular expression.

Building on that, we proved the decidability of equivalence of regular expressions in Theorem \ref{re_equiv_correct} with the help of decision procedure for equivalence of finite automata.

Theorem \ref{dfa_to_re} shows that we can give an equivalent regular expression for every automaton.
