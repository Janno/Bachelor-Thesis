\chapter{Coq, \ssreflect}

\paragraph{}
We decided to employ the Small Scale Reflection Extension (\textbf{\ssreflect}) for the \textbf{\coq} proof assistant. 
The most important factors in this decision were \ssreflect's excellent support for finite types, list operations and graphs. \ssreflect{} also introduces many syntactic extensions that can often be used to shorten the bookkeeping overhead of proofs considerably.
