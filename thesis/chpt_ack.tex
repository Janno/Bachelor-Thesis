\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my advisor Christian Doczkal for the countless hours spent guiding me and helping me overcome the difficulties I encountered both with the formalization and the process of writing this thesis.
His helpful advice and frank criticism were invaluable to me.

I would also like to thank my supervisor Prof. Gert Smolka for introducing me to the 
field of formal logic and providing me with such a challenging and rewarding topic for my bachelor's thesis.
I am also very thankful for his continued support during the entire project.

Furthermore, I would like to thank Prof. Gert Smolka and Prof. Finkbeiner for reviewing this thesis.

Special thanks to Andrea Fischer and Yannick Baron, who helped me greatly.
