\chapter{Decidable Languages}

\section{Definition}
\paragraph{}
We closely follow the definitions from \cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0011126}.
An \textbf{alphabet} $\Sigma$ is a finite set of symbols. Throughout this document, we will assume a fixed alphabet.
A \textbf{word} $w$ is a finite sequence of symbols chosen from some alphabet. 
We use $|w|$ to denote the \textbf{length} of a word $w$. 
Given two words $w_1 = a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n$ and $w_2 = b_1 b_2 \cdots b_m$, the \textbf{concatenation} of $w_1$ and $w_2$ is defined as $a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n b_1 b_2 \cdots b_m$ and denoted $w_1 \cdot w_2$ or just $w_1 w_2$.
A \textbf{language} is a set of words.
The \textbf{residual language} of a language $L$ with respect $v$ is the set of words $u$ such that $u v$ is in $L$.
We define $\Sigma^k$ to be the \textbf{set of words of length k}.
The \textbf{set of all words} over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is denoted $\Sigma^*$, i.e.,$\Sigma^* = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \Sigma^k$.

\paragraph{} We restrict all further discussion to \textbf{decidable languages}:
\begin{equation*} \mathcal{L}_{dec} := \{ \, L \, \subseteq \, \Sigma^* \, 
    \vert \, \exists f. \, \forall x \in \Sigma^*. \, f(x) = 1 \Leftrightarrow  x \in L. \} \end{equation*} 

    \paragraph{} 
    We employ finite types to formalize alphabets. 
    Words are formalized as sequences over the alphabet.
    Decidable languages are represented by functions from $word$ to $bool$.

    \subsection{Operation on languages}

    \paragraph{}

    The \textbf{concatenation of two languages} $L_1$ and $L_2$ is denoted $L_1 \cdot L_2$ and is defined as the set of words $w_1 w_2$ such that $w_1$ is in $L_1$ and $w_2$ is in $L_2$.
    The \textbf{Kleene Star of a language} (also called Kleene closure) $L$ is denoted $L^*$ and is defined as the set of words $w_1 w_2 \cdots w_k$ such that $w_1, w_2, \cdots w_k$ are in $L$.
    We define the \textbf{complement} of a language $L$ as $L \backslash \Sigma^*$, which we denote $\neg L$.
    Furthermore, we make use of the standard set operations \textbf{union} and \textbf{intersection}.

    \paragraph{}
    We take Coquand and Siles's \cite{DBLP:conf/cpp/CoquandS11} implementation of these operators. ``plus'' and ``prod'' refer to union and intersection, respectively.

    \codeblock{lang_plus}{}{regexp_plus}
    \codeblock{lang_prod}{}{regexp_prod}

    \begin{theorem}{}
        \label{DecLangClosed}
        The decidable languages are closed under concatenation, Kleene star, union, intersection and negation. 
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For concatenation and the Kleene star, the validity of this claim is easily seen by considering nonempty substrings, of which there are finitely many. 
        The boolean operations can be applied directly to the decision functions.
    \end{proof}

    \paragraph{}
    We have already given decision algorithms for every operator. 
    It remains to show that they are correct.








    \section{Regular Languages}


    \begin{definition}{}
        \label{REG}
        The set of regular languages $REG$ is defined to be exactly those languages generated by the following inductive definition.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item
                $\emptyset \in REG$, 
            \item
                $\forall a \in \Sigma. \, \{a\} \in REG$, 
            \item
                $\forall L_1, L_2 \in REG. \, L_1^* \in REG, \, L_1 \cup L_2 \in REG, \, L_1 \cdot L_2 \in REG$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{definition}


    \subsection{Regular Expressions}

    \paragraph{} 
    Regular expressions mirror the definition of regular languages very closely. 
    We will consider \textbf{extended regular expressions} that include negation ($Not$), intersection ($And$) and $.$ ($Dot$), which is a single-symbol wildcard. 
    We take the implementation from Coquand and Siles's development (\cite{DBLP:conf/cpp/CoquandS11}), which is also based on \ssreflect\ and comes with helpful infrastructure for our proofs.

    \code{regexp}{Regular Expressions}{regexp_regular_expression}

    \todo{Standard regular expressions, boolean predicate}

    \paragraph{}
    We will later prove that this definition is equivalent to the inductive definition of regular languages in \ref{REG}.
    In order to do that, we introduce a predicate on regular expressions that distinguishes \textbf{standard regular expressions} 
    from \textbf{extended regular expressions} (as introduced above).
    Standard regular expression consist only of $Void$, $Eps$, $Atom$, $Star$ and $Plus$.

    \todo{Connect standard regexp to reg. languages}


    \subsection{Deciding Language Membership}
    \paragraph{}
    We make use of \textbf{derivatives of regular expressions} (\cite{DBLP:journals/jacm/Brzozowski64}) to decide if a word $w \in \Sigma^*$ is contained in the language $\lang{r}$ of the regular expression $r$. 
    Derivatives are themselves regular expressions and are computed with respect to a single input character. 
    In order to define derivatives, we first define a related concept.

    %\begin{definition}{}
    %    \label{residual}
    %    The residual of a regular expression w.r.t to a character $a$ is the set of words $w$ such that $a \cdot w \in L$.
    %    \code{regexp_resiual}{}{regexp_residual}
    %\end{definition}

    \begin{definition}{}
        \label{derivative}
        The derivative $der \,  a \, r$ of $r$ w.r.t. to $a$ is defined such that 
        \begin{equation*}       \forall w \in \Sigma^*. \, w \, \in \, \lang{der \, a \, r} \Leftrightarrow w \, \in \, residual \, a \, \lang{r}. \end{equation*}
        \end{definition}

        \paragraph{}
        A suitable implementation is provided by Coquand and Siles.

        \code{regexp_der}{Derivatives of Regular Expressions}{regexp_der}


        \begin{theorem}
            \label{der_correct}
            For all $r$, $w$ and $a$, we have that $w \in der \, a \, r$ if and only if $w \in residual \, a $.
        \end{theorem}

        \begin{proof}
            We prove the claim by induction over $r$. Two cases are non-trivial: 
%                        \begin{enumerate}
%                            \item
%                                $der \, a \, (Conc \, r_1 \, r_2)$: 
%                                We have to check if $r_1$ accepts the empty word. 
%                                If it does not, the derivative is $Conc \, (der \, a \, r_1) \, r_2$.
%                                If it does, we also have to consider the case that the caracter $a$ is a prefix of a word in $\lang{r_2}$.
%                            \item
%                                $Star \, r_1$: 
%                                We have that $w \in \lang{r_1^*}$ if and only if 
%                                \todo{Fix one def. of *}
%                                \begin{equation*}
%                                    \, \exists n. \, \exists v_1 .. v_n. \, w \, = \, v_1 \cdot .. \cdot v_n 
%                                    \wedge \forall i. \, 1 \leq i \leq n 
%                                    \Rightarrow
%                                    \, v_i \in \lang{r_1}.
%                                \end{equation*}
%                        \end{enumerate}
            \todo{Proof}
        \end{proof}

        \paragraph{} 
        Given the defining property of derivatives, we can easily see that a generalization of $der$ to words suffices to decide language membership. We only need to check if the derivative w.r.t. to a given word accepts the empty word.

        \code{regexp_mem_der}{}{regexp_mem_der}

        \begin{theorem}
            \label{mem_der_correct} 
            The language of a regular expression $r$ is decidable, i.e.
            \begin{equation*}     w \in \lang{r} \Leftrightarrow \varepsilon \in \lang{mem\_der \, r \, w}.      \end{equation*}
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                \todo{Proof}.
            \end{proof}
